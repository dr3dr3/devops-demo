# Learning DevOps

### By Doing It

---

# Why?

------

<!-- .slide: id="lean-startup-canvas" -->

## Lean Startup Canvas

------

### Problems to Solve

* List your customer's top 3x problems
* List how these problems are solved today

------

### Problem #1

I've heard about the benefits of DevOps...

But struggle to really understand why it is better.

------

### Problem #2

I understand the concepts of Devops...

But don't have experience in doing it.

------

### Problem #3

I want to apply DevOps to my work...

But certifications only give me knowledge, not practice.

------

### How Solve These Today?

* Work where they are doing DevOps well
* Work for a DevOps consultancy 
* Try it out myself on a personal project

Note: You are lucky if you work at a place doing DevOps well... or getting to work with an experienced DevOps consultant. Trying it out on your own project is hard.

------

### Solution

DevOps Demo is a guided do-it-yourself project 

Covering the full spectrum of DevOps concepts

So you...

* Appreciate the value of DevOps first hand
* Get hands-on experience applying DevOps
* Deeper learning of DevOps through practice

------

### Value Proposition

Unlike other courses or certifications... you will apply DevOps practices whilst building/running your own personal website. One that also showcases your DevOps knowledge and applied skills. 

------

### High-Level Concept

DevOps Demo is like learning a language by visiting the country (as opposed to just studying it via a book). 

And then having a the photos and videos to show off your new language skills.

------

### Unfair Advantage

Learning that also provides applied practice and something to showcase for it.

------

### Customer Segments

* Those considering DevOps certification / courses
* Software Engineers / Budding DevOps Engineers
* Agile practioners (Scrum Masters, etc)

------

### Customer's Customers

* Potential employers (demonstrate DevOps expertise)
