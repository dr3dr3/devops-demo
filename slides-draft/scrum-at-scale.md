<!-- .slide: id="struggle" -->

## Struggles

Why are organizations struggling to be Agile?

------

## Prioritization

The #1 Challenge

If you can't **prioritize**, cool agile tools will only make you feel better as you fail.

------

## Rate of Delivery

If you can **deliver**, cool technical tools will just keep you busy as you fail.

------

## Refactor Organization

If you can't regularly **refactor** the organization to focus on priorities, no scaling framework will prevent you from failing.

------

## Culture

If you can't change your **company culture** being at odds with agility, your implementation will limp along.

---

<!-- .slide: id="agile-architecture" -->

## Agile Architecture

------

Underlying structure is a set of largely independent business components with pre-defined interfaces (inputs / outputs).

------

Stable interfaces allow for the components to be modified without disrupting the entire system.

------

This enables organizational design to "emerge" rapidly in response to inspect and adapt cycles. 

---

<!-- .slide: id="mega-issues" -->

## Mega Issues

------

## 1. Prioritization

Every team has a clear, ordered backlog every sprint so they know exactly what they need to do and in what order.

------

## 2. Working Product

How often are you releasing value to customers?

------

## 3. Organization Refactoring

Team's are easily refactored to optimize production. 

Our reliance on SMEs limits our ability to refactor.

------

## 4. Company Culture
