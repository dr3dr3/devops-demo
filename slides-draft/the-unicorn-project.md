### Purpose Here...

To help you find and tell your story

----

* Stories have a formula
* The Unicorn Project story follows this formula
* Learn this formula
* Use it to tell your story

----

### The Story Formula

StoryBrand is a book by Donald Miller

Great tool for understanding the formula of a story

----

* A character (our Hero)
* Has a problem (serious and about survival)
* And meets a guide
* Who gives them a plan
* And calls them to action
* That helps them avoid failure + doom
* And ends in success

---- 

In this presentation we will show how The Unicorn Project follows the story formula using the StoryBrand framework.

----

You can use this formula and use The Unicorn Project as a kick-start for your story!

----

Tailor your story of adopting modern practices that transform your life and those around you.
