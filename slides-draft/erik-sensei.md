> "When you put them all on one switch, you complected their value streams, all now having dependencies on each other that didn't exist before. They must constantly communicate, coordinate, schedule, marshal, sequence, and deconflict their work. They now have an extremely high cost of coorindation, which has lengthened lead times, decreased quality, and, in your story, led to a week-long catastophe that significantly impaired the business." - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)
