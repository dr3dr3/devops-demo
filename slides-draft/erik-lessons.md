The Second Ideal - Focus, Flow, and Joy
The Third Ideal - Improvement of Daily Work
The Fourth Ideal - Psychological Safety
The Fifth Ideal - Customer Focus

----

#### Locality and Simplicity

> "We need to design things so that we have locality in our systems and the organizations that build them. And we need simplicity in everything we do." - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

#### Focus, Flow, and Joy

> "All about how our daily work feels." - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

#### Improvement to Daily Work

> "..."

----

#### Psychological Safety

> "We make it safe to talk about problems, because solving problems requires prevention, which requires honesty, and honesty requires the absence of fear." - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

#### Customer Focus

> "We ruthlessly question whether something actually matters to our customers, as in, are they willing to pay us for it or is it only of value to our functional silo?" - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

---

# Simplicity and Locality

----

> "Simplicity is important because it enables locality. Locality in our code is what keeps systems loosely coupled, enabling us to deliver features faster."

----

> "Team can quickly and independently develop, test, and deploy value to customers."

----

> "Locality in our organizations allows teams to make decisions without having to communicate and coordinate with people outside the team, potentially having to get approveals from distant authorities or committees so far removed from teh work that they have no relevant basis to make good decisions."

----

> "You should be able to create value by changing one file, one module, one service, one component, one API call, one container, one app, or whatever!"

----

> "Which is why putting cross-cutting concerns in one place is so great, like logging, security, or retry policies. You change it there, and you've changed it everywhere."

----

> "Isn't it absurd that when you build a feature, changes sometimes have to be made by the UI team, the front-end team, the back-end team, and the database team?"

----

> "We need to design things so that we have locality in our systems and the organizations that build them. And we need simplicity in everything we do." - Erik (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

> "The last place we want complexity is internally, whether it's in our code, in our organization, or in our processes. The external world is complex enough, so it would be intolerable if we allow it in things we can actually control!" (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

> "We must make it easy to do our work." (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

> "And achieving this greatness is never free. It requires focus and elevation of improvement of daily work, even over the daily work itself."


---

### Complexity Debt

Aka "Technical Debt"

----

> "Without this ruthless focus, every system degrades over time, increasingly buried under a tundra of technical debt."

----

> "I've started calling all of these things 'complexity debt' because they're not just technical issues - they are business issues. And it's always a choice. You can choose to build new features or you can choose to pay down complexity debt."

----

> "When a fool spends all their time on features, the inevitable outsome is that even easy tasks become difficult and take longer to execute."

----

> "And no matter how hard you try or how many people you have, it eventually collapses under its own weight, forcing you to start over from scratch."

---

# Focus, Flow, and Joy

----

> "Do we blindly work on small peives of the whole, only seeing hte outcomes of our work during a deployment when everything blows up, leading to firefighting, punishment, and burn-out?" (Chapter #7 - The Unicorn Project)

----

> "Or do we work in small batches, ideally single-peice flow, getting fast and continual feedback on our work?"

> "These are the conditions that allow for focus and flow, challenge, learning, discovery, mastering our domain, and even joy."
